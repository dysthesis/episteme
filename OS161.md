## Thread questions

### General notes

- The source code for [[OS161]] are well documented. When in doubt, read the comments on the source code.

### What happens to a thread when it exits (*i.e.* calls `thread_exit()`)? What about when it sleeps?

`thread_exit()` has the following implementation in [[OS161]]:

```C
/*
 * Cause the current thread to exit.
 *
 * The parts of the thread structure we don't actually need to run
 * should be cleaned up right away. The rest has to wait until
 * thread_destroy is called from exorcise().
 *
 * Does not return.
 */
void
thread_exit(void)
{
	struct thread *cur;
	
	cur = curthread;
	
	/*
	 * Detach from our process. You might need to move this action
	 * around, depending on how your wait/exit works.
	 */
	proc_remthread(cur);
	
	/* Make sure we *are* detached (move this only if you're sure!) */
	KASSERT(cur->t_proc == NULL);
	
	/* Check the stack guard band. */
	thread_checkstack(cur);
	
	/* Interrupts off on this processor */
        splhigh();
	thread_switch(S_ZOMBIE, NULL, NULL);
	panic("braaaaaaaiiiiiiiiiiinssssss\n");
}
```

From the code above, it can be deduced that `*cur` is a pointer to the currently executing thread.  The functions  The function can then be broken down as follows:

1. `proc_remthread(cur)`: Remove the currently executing thread from its parent process, as it might still be associated with some [[Resources|resources]] of the parent process.
2. `KASSERT(curr->t_proc == NULL)`: Check that it actually detached properly, panic otherwise.
3. `thread_checkstack(cur)`: Check that the magic number on the bottom end of the stack is intact. This acts as a canary to verify that no buffer overflows have occurred.
4. `splhigh()`: Set the priority level (presumably of this [[Process|process]]) to the highest possible value, which would ==disable all interrupts==. This is presumably to prevent any [[Concurrency|concurrency]] issues.
5. `thread_switch(S_ZOMBIE, NULL, NULL)`: Change the current thread's state to `ZOMBIE` and select a different [[Process|process]] to run.

The source code for the kernel contains a good description of how priority levels work:

> [!quote] `kern/include/spl.h`, line 46
>  The idea is that one can block less important interrupts while processing them, but still allow more urgent interrupts to interrupt that processing.

> [!quote] AI (`deepseek-coder-33b`)
> This C code is part of the OS/161 kernel and defines a function named `thread_exit`. This function is used to cause the current thread to exit, cleaning up its resources and ending its execution. Here's a breakdown of what it does:
>
> 1. The function first saves a pointer to the currently executing thread (the one that called this function) into the variable `cur`.
> 2. Then, the function detaches the current thread from its process by calling the function `proc_remthread(cur)`. This is done because the thread might still be associated with some resources of its parent process.
> 3. It then checks if the thread has been successfully detached (by checking if `t_proc` field of the `struct thread` is NULL). If not, it panics and exits immediately. 
> 4. After that, it calls `thread_checkstack(cur)` to ensure that the current stack pointer does not cross into protected areas. This can be used as a form of protection against buffer overflow attacks. 
> 5. The function then disables interrupts on the CPU using `splhigh()`, which is an operation-specific part of OS/161 kernel code and may be platform dependent (i.e., it might use specific instructions provided by your processor).
> 6. After that, it calls `thread_switch(S_ZOMBIE, NULL, NULL)` to switch the thread state into 'zombie' mode. This means that the thread has finished its execution but is waiting for its parent process to clean up any remaining resources.
> 7. Finally, if the code reaches this point, it panics and exits immediately. The panic message "braaaaaaaiiiiiiiiiiinssssss" suggests that something went wrong with the exit procedure of the current thread.
> In essence, this function is responsible for cleaning up resources associated with a thread once it's done executing its code and is ready to be cleaned up by its parent process. It may seem somewhat unusual given how `panic` terminates the program execution, but in OS/161 kernel design, the panic is used to indicate unexpected conditions that should not occur under normal circumstances, thus ensuring a more robust and reliable system.

	 * switchframe_switch returns immediately in another thread
	 * context, which in general will be executing here with a
	 * different stack and different values in the local
	 * variables. (Although new threads go to thread_startup
	 * instead.) But, later on when the processor, or some
	 * processor, comes back to the previous thread, it's also
	 * executing here with the *same* value in the local
	 * variables.
	 *
	 * The upshot, however, is as follows:
	 *
	 *    - The thread now currently running is "cur", not "next",
	 *      because when we return from switchrame_switch on the
	 *      same stack, we're back to the thread that
	 *      switchframe_switch call switched away from, which is
	 *      "cur".
	 *
	 *    - "cur" is _not_ the thread that just *called*
	 *      switchframe_switch.
	 *
	 *    - If newstate is S_ZOMB we never get back here in that
	 *      context at all.
	 *
	 *    - If the thread just chosen to run ("next") was a new
	 *      thread, we don't get to this code again until
	 *      *another* context switch happens, because when new
	 *      threads return from switchframe_switch they teleport
	 *      to thread_startup.
	 *
	 *    - At this point the thread whose stack we're now on may
	 *      have been migrated to another cpu since it last ran.
	 *
	 * The above is inherently confusing and will probably take a
	 * while to get used to.
	 *
	 * However, the important part is that code placed here, after
	 * the call to switchframe_switch, does not necessarily run on
	 * every context switch. Thus any such code must be either
	 * skippable on some switches or also called from
	 * thread_startup.
